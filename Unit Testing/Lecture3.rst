ðŸ§© What Is Feature-Based Architecture?

Feature-based architecture (also called modular architecture) organizes your app by features or modules, instead of by file type (like components/, screens/, hooks/, etc.).

In other words, each feature gets its own folder that contains everything related to that feature â€” components, screens, styles, tests, hooks, and logic.

ðŸ“‚ 1. Traditional (Type-Based) Structure

This is how many beginners structure apps:

src/
 â”œâ”€â”€ components/
 â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
 â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
 â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
 â””â”€â”€ navigation/


Here, you separate by type of file (components, screens, etc.), not by feature.
This works for small apps, but gets messy as the app grows â€” you might end up jumping around folders to find files for a single feature.

ðŸ§± 2. Feature-Based Structure

In this approach, your folders are organized by feature instead of file type:

src/
 â”œâ”€â”€ features/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginForm.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SignupForm.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginScreen.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SignupScreen.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useAuth.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ authApi.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.test.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
 â”‚   â”‚
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ profile/
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProfileScreen.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProfileHeader.js
 â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ profileApi.js
 â”‚   â”‚
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home/
 â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.js
 â”‚       â””â”€â”€ homeApi.js
 â”‚
 â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/
 â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
 â”œâ”€â”€ constants/
 â””â”€â”€ App.js


Now, everything related to authentication, profile, or home is grouped together.
If you ever need to remove or refactor a feature, itâ€™s mostly isolated to one folder âœ…

ðŸŽ¯ 3. Benefits of Feature-Based Architecture
Benefit	Explanation
Encapsulation	Each feature owns its logic, components, and styles. Less risk of breaking other parts.
Scalability	Easy to add or remove features without affecting others.
Collaboration	Teams can work on different features in parallel with minimal conflicts.
Better testing organization	Each feature can have its own test suite.
Easier maintenance	You donâ€™t have to search across folders for related files.
ðŸ§  4. Hybrid Example (Feature + Shared)

In real-world apps, you often mix feature-based with some shared folders for reusable logic:

src/
 â”œâ”€â”€ features/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home/
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ profile/
 â”‚
 â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Shared reusable UI components
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/        # Shared custom hooks
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/        # Common helper functions
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ constants/    # Colors, strings, etc.
 â”‚
 â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/
 â””â”€â”€ App.js


This way, shared functionality (like a custom Button or useNetworkStatus) isnâ€™t tied to one feature.

ðŸ§ª 5. Testing in Feature-Based Architecture

Each feature can have its own test folder:

features/
 â””â”€â”€ auth/
     â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginScreen.test.js
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useAuth.test.js


This keeps tests close to the code theyâ€™re testing â€” a best practice for unit and integration testing.
