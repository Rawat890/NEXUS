(a) FLAT ARCHITECTURE
usually for small architecture
project folder structure that avoids deeply nested directories â€” instead, it keeps files and components organized in a flat and simple hierarchy.
Easier to navigate
Easier to scale
Less coupled between modules

example - 
src/
 â”œâ”€â”€ components/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PrimaryButton.js
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SecondaryButton.js
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.js
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.js
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProfileScreen.js
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SettingsScreen.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api.js
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ formatDate.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useAuth.js
 â””â”€â”€ App.js


ðŸŽ¯ 3. Why Flat Architecture is Useful in React Native

React Native projects benefit from flat structures because:

RN apps tend to have many small UI components â€” a deep tree gets confusing fast.

Metro bundler (used by RN) doesnâ€™t need deep folder hierarchies â€” it can load modules efficiently from a flat structure.

Easier collaboration: teammates can quickly find and modify components.

Simplifies testing, since test files can live next to components or in a single __tests__ folder.
