Hashing is used to store the objects in the heap memory as it cannot store data in contiguous manner 
The optimization technique is used in order to access the data.

Advanced Loops in javascript - 
for in loop - specifically use to iterate the keys of the objects

Object.keys only prints the keys that is of that particular objects, but for in also prints the inherited properties as well

Whenever we create a key value paor in object, 3 properties added by default - enumerable, writable and configurable

If configurable is true, then we can change boolena values of other 2 properties
