DECODING IP ADDRESS
1974, protocols created that is TCP/IP protocols that is used in ARPANET.

Networking is copy of post office

Size is fixed for IP address that is 32 bits also called [IPV4]
example - 192  . 36 . 15 .  8   (computer)     human readable
           8bit 8bit 8bit 8bit

Whichever device connected to internet has given a IP address

[computer1] ---------------->Router1------------->Router2------------>[computer2]
192.08.21.11                   |                    |                  04.34.21.4
                             Router3---------------Router4   
                               |                    |
                             Router5--------------Router6------------Router7------->[computer3]  
                               |                    |
                           [computer4]            [computer5]

Nowadays IPV6 is used. - 128 bits (2^128) devices have IP ADDRESS

Who provides the IP address ?
The organization that provides the services like Jio , airtel, Vi

But nowadays, do we put the ip address which is not possible to remember to visit a website?
Nope, google.com takes you to google website
This is made possible by DNS (domain name is easy to remember) - coverts domain name to ip address.

Client --------------------->ISP--------------------------------> Root name server (.com, .in, .net)
youtube.com          {cache is stored}         if not present          |
                     most visited websites ----------------------------  (sends ip of server of that
         ----------->youtube.com: 192.23.4.55                             .com domain)
        |                      |
        |                      |
        |              Top level domain server (.com)
        |                      |
         ------------- Authorative main server (particular of multiple that can do the job)
                        (sends ip address)

Domains like - youtube, amazon given static ip address as they have to active 24 x 7
Other devices are given ip address dynamically , when connected to internet provided by internet providers and when internet disconnected, ip address taken from the device and allocated to other one

There are 13 root name servers, but each of these represents a cluster of many physical servers distributed globally using anycast routing.

Class A - 50%  ip address
Class B - 25%
Class C - 12.5%
Class D - 6.25%
Class E - 6.25%
