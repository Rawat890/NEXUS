ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange and is a character encoding standard that assigns numerical values to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters used by computers and electronic devices. It uses seven bits to represent 128 different characters, with codes 0-31 for non-printing control functions and 32-127 for printable characters like the English alphabet and common symbols.
Modern computers often use extended ASCII (8-bit) or the more universal Unicode standard to support a wider range of characters, but ASCII remains a foundational standard for basic text and data exchange, especially in web and software development
2^8 = 256 characters
But is there are only 256 characters in world? -> emoji, hindi words, chinese etc.
ASCII not fullProof

So UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 used nowadays.

System only understands binary, It's our duty to convert

Computer ------------------->Assembler<-------------Assembly Language
(binary only)                converts               ADD 23 

Computer ------------------->compiler<-------------High level Language
(binary only)                converts               ADD 23 

Machine language > Assembly language > High level language

Circuit switching - 
Computer1---->p1---->p2----->p3----->p4----->Computer2
  binary            telephone lining
                    (analog signals)

To overcome the drawbacks -->
ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the precursor to the modern internet, developed by the United States Department of Defense's ARPA in the late 1960s to connect research institutions and government agencies. It pioneered packet switching, a method of breaking data into small packets for transmission across a decentralized network, and was the first to implement the TCP/IP protocol, which forms the basis of the internet today. ARPANET also supported key applications like email, FTP, and Telnet, laying the groundwork for the global internet
Got success in 1969 and 1st message was "login" and received only "lo" and System crashed
