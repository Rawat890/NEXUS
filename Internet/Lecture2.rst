ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange and is a character encoding standard that assigns numerical values to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters used by computers and electronic devices. It uses seven bits to represent 128 different characters, with codes 0-31 for non-printing control functions and 32-127 for printable characters like the English alphabet and common symbols.
Modern computers often use extended ASCII (8-bit) or the more universal Unicode standard to support a wider range of characters, but ASCII remains a foundational standard for basic text and data exchange, especially in web and software development
2^8 = 256 characters
But is there are only 256 characters in world? -> emoji, hindi words, chinese etc.
ASCII not fullProof

So UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 used nowadays.

System only understands binary, It's our duty to convert
